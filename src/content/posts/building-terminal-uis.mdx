# Building Terminal-Inspired UIs

Terminal interfaces have a timeless appeal. They prioritize function over form, yet their stark aesthetic has influenced a generation of developers.

## Why TUI?

Text User Interfaces (TUIs) are efficient. They rely on keyboard navigation, monospaced fonts, and high-contrast color schemes.

### key principles

1.  **Monospace Typography**: Everything aligns on a grid.
2.  **Keyboard First**: Mouse is optional.
3.  **High Contrast**: Light text on dark backgrounds (usually).

In this post, we'll explore how to bring these concepts to the modern web using React and Tailwind CSS.
